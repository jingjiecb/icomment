      # Sign the resulting Docker image digest except on PRs.
      # This will only write to the public Rekor transparency log when the Docker
      # repository is public to verify the image origin.
      # ie- only for public images, but optional really. Removing cosign signing to keep it simple as requested,
      # unless user wants high security. The prompt didn't strictly ask for signing, just build and push.
      # I will remove the cosign step to avoid confusion if keyless signing isn't desired or configured.
      # Actually, I'll allow it but simplify. Wait, the prompt asked for "simple and modern".
      # Using official starter workflow often includes cosign.
      # I'll stick to the core request: build and push with specific tags.
